    <h2>MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.</h2>

    <h3>No. XVII.&mdash;GASPS.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>By</i> OLPH SCHREION, <i>Author of "Screams," "The
    Allegory of an Asian Ranche.</i>")</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>["You will perceive," writes the Author of the following
        story, "that this is allegorical, but it is not by any
        means necessary that you should understand it. The chief
        charm of allegorical writing is its absolute freedom from
        the trammels of convention. You write something large and
        vague, with any amount of symbols thrown in. The words flow
        quite easily; you cover scores of pages. Then you read it
        over again next morning. If you understand it so little as
        to think some other fellow must have written it, you may be
        quite certain it is an allegory. When you print it, your
        public reads into it all kinds of mysterious and morbid
        religious emotions, and confused misinterpretations of
        life-problems, and everybody tacks on his own special
        explanation. That being so, it is quite unnecessary for you
        to explain things&mdash;which saves a great deal of
        trouble. The plan is an excellent one. Try it.&mdash;Yours,
        allegorically, O.S."]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <p>TANT' SANNIE was stewing <i>kraut</i> in the old Dutch
    saucepan. The scorching rays of the African sun were beating
    down upon BONAPARTE BLENKINS who was doing his best to be
    sun-like by beating WALDO. His nose was red and disagreeable.
    He was something like HUCKLEBERRY FINN's Dauphin, an amusing,
    callous, cruel rogue, but less resourceful. TANT' SANNIE
    laughed; it was so pleasant to see a German boy beaten black
    and blue. But the Hottentot servants merely gaped. It was their
    custom.</p>

    <div class="figright"

             alt="Tant' Sannie." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>But in the middle distance Life was playing marbles with the
    Unknown. And the Unknown said unto Life, "Give me an
    alley-tor." But Life replied, "Nay, for the commoneys are lying
    well, and the thumb of him that aimeth is seasoned unto the
    stroke." And the Unknown beat his sable wings together, and one
    black feather flitted far into the breast of the day and fell
    to earth. And there came a fair-haired Child plucking flowers
    in the desert with brows bent in thought.</p>

    <p>And Life said unto the Child, "Play with me."</p>

    <p>And the Unknown said, "Play with me."</p>

    <p>But the Child raised its soft hand slowly and the tender
    fingers grew apart, and its thumb was poised in thought upon
    its nose, and it spake not at all. And the feather flitted far,
    far over the waste, and men came forth and gazed upon it, but
    it heeded them not.</p>

    <p>Then said Life, "I am strong. Kings have need of me and
    earth is my dominion." But the Unknown gathered up the
    scattered marbles, concealing them gently, and answered only
    this&mdash;"I am a greater than Life."</p>

    <p>And the Child strayed onwards and the feather flitted, and
    TANT' SANNIE still stewed <i>kraut</i> in the old Dutch
    saucepan. And BONAPARTE BLENKINS was glad.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>Cruelty, cruelty, cruelty&mdash;all is cruelty! Boys are
    beaten; oxen are stabbed till the blood bursts forth; happy,
    industrious, dung-collecting beetles are bitten in two by
    careless, happy, beetle-collecting dogs&mdash;everything is
    wicked and cruel. The Kaffir has beautiful legs, but he will
    kick his wife, and TANT' SANNIE, alas! will not be there to
    drop a pickle-tub on his head. And over everything hangs that
    inscrutable charm which hovers for ever for the human intellect
    over the incomprehensible and shadowy. <i>Omne ignotum pro
    mirifico</i>, I might say, but I prefer the longer phrase.</p>

    <p>And I stood at the gate of Heaven, I and TANT' SANNIE; and
    we spoke to everybody quite affably; and they all had time to
    listen to what we said, and to make suitable replies.</p>

    <p>And I said, "Are we all here?"</p>

    <p>And she said, "Not all."</p>

    <p>And I said, "The absent are always in the wrong."</p>

    <p>And she said, "I have heard that in French."</p>

    <p>And I said, "Is not that impertinent?"</p>

    <p>And she said, "No."</p>

    <p>And a great Light fell across her face, as though a palm had
    smitten it, and the name of the palm was Hand, and its fruits
    were fingers five.</p>

    <p>And again I addressed myself in terms of familiarity to the
    Ever-lasting, and I planted a book upon the clouds, where eight
    children lay prone with bees flying about their childish
    bonnets.</p>

    <p>And there came a knock at my door.</p>

    <p>"Eight o'clock!" said One. "Arise!"</p>

    <p>"Nay," I answered; "it cannot be."</p>

    <p>"But the water is hot within the can, and the table will be
    spread for them that break their fast."</p>

    <p>"So be it. I rise." And behold it was a dream!</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>Far away the mother of the little nigger stood churning.
    Where is the mother of the little black nigger? She is churning
    slowly in the garden. But cannot the aunt of the good gardener
    churn herself? No; for she is in the orchard, plucking the
    apples, peaches, apricots, pears (<i>Birnen</i>), to give to
    the butler's grandmother.</p>

    <p>And there came Life and The Ideal walking hand in hand. And
    behind them came Wealth and Vastness singing together. And
    Infinity was there, and Health, and Wisdom, and Love. And
    Reflection was mounted on a steed with Joy. And many other
    shapes followed, delicately arrayed in fine linen. And
    helmet-wearing Men in Blue marshalled the procession. And they
    spake roughly, saying, "Pass away there, pass away there!"</p>

    <p>And I said, "Is this the Lord Mayor's Show?"</p>

    <p>And One said, "No."</p>

    <p>And I said, "Is it the Salvation Army?"</p>

    <p>And again One said, "No."</p>

    <p>And I said, "Is it SEQUAH?"</p>

    <p>And One said again. "No."</p>

    <p>And I said, "I have guessed enough."</p>

    <p>And One said, "Yes."</p>

    <p>But The Real was not there, and they passed away.</p>

    <p>And One said, "I am Wealth," which was absurd, but No-one
    laughed. And they all danced a fandango on the points of their
    toes. And a shaft of light lay over them. And they wandered on.
    At last they came to a bad, wicked naughty, brimstone place.
    And I said to Some-one, "I like this. It seems a good place."
    And still No-one laughed. And Wealth touched me, and I was
    glad. And I said, "Give me millions, or buy a box of matches,"
    and Law seized me and took me to the Cell. Then I said to the
    Beak, "Your Worship." And the Beak said unto me, "Begging
    again. Forty shillings." And again I woke. And it was all a
    striving and a striving and an ending in Nothing.</p>

    <h2>OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, May 4</i>.&mdash;ZÉLIE DE LUSSAN's <i>Carmen</i>
    is about the best when all the other dear charmers are away,
    and in the character she will probably remain in possession of
    the field, or, rather, "the Garden," till the end of the
    season. The remainder as before, with DEVOYOD as
    <i>Escamillo</i>. But what has become of the "go" in the
    <i>Toréador's</i> great song? Where are the double
    <i>encores</i>? Where, indeed, the hearty applause? Surely it
    has gone the way of the March in <i>Faust</i>, once so
    enthusiastically received and cheered to the echo; and
    now&mdash;"March off!" It is true that, once let a "tuney tune"
    become vulgarised by street-musicians, and organic disease
    would be sufficient to kill it were it not tortured and ground
    to death by remorseless hands. But the <i>Toréador's</i> song
    and the March have not been the victims of an organised
    opposition. Perhaps, though, they may have been, only 'tis so
    long ago as not to be within the ken of the present deponent.
    Anyhow, the <i>Toréador's</i> song goes for nothing nowadays,
    and yet 'tis as good as ever.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;We welcomed <i>The Don</i>. Not the
    Academic Don once so popularly represented by Mr. J.L. TOOLE,
    but MOZART's Italianised Spanish Don. <i>À propos</i> of Mr.
    TOOLE, it has always been the wonder of his friends, to whom
    the quality of his vocal powers is so well known, that he has
    never been tempted to renounce the simple histrionic for the
    lyric Drama. It is said, and "greatly to his credit," that, had
    it not been for his unwillingness to rob his friend SIMS REEVES
    of the laurel-crown he wears as first English Tenor of his age,
    he would long ago have set up a most dangerous opposition to
    that sweet singer, and have ridden off victoriously with "<i>My
    Pretty Jane</i>" seated up behind him, pillion-wise, on the
    noble steed known as "<i>The Bay of Biscay O!</i>"</p>

    <p>But the above is an <i>entr'acte</i>, shorter than those at
    Covent Garden, by the way. M. MAUREL first-rate as the
    <i>Don</i>, both in acting and singing, even better in former
    than latter; but the dear old serenade, which never can be
    vulgarised, in spite of its popularity, was encored, and the
    encore was gracefully accepted, Signor BEVIGNANI being in the
    chair, and willing to tap the desk and announce, "Gentlemen!
    Monsieur MAUREL will oblige again!" Applause.</p>

    <p>If all the village maidens could dress in a costume such as
    Miss ZÉLIE-ZERLINA wears, then, to take the best and nicest
    view of it, that village must be uncommonly prosperous.
    Probably tourists' visits are not few and far between: but
    anyhow, even the most unsuspicious bumpkin of a lover, would be
    inclined to ask a few questions about this finery. However, her
    performance was as fine as the dress, and she looked quite the
    ZÉLIE-ZERLINA, so fascinating to the Lord and the Lout.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;<i>Roméo et Juliette</i>, that is, M.
    JEAN DE RESZKÉ and Mlle. EAMES. A nearly perfect performance.
    JEAN a trifle too stout for an ideal <i>Romeo</i>, but of
    course he couldn't go into training for the part at short
    notice. The spirit with which he played the part far outweighed
    the error of the flesh. Miss EAMES a charming <i>Juliet</i> in
    every way, though her singing of the waltz was not of dazzling
    firework brilliancy. Brother NED was the <i>Frère Laurent</i>.
    Excellent. The name Anglo-Frenchified, suggests a reverend
    gentleman who would meddle with legal marriages and perform
    private ceremonies without leave or licence from his Ordinary,
    and might be known as Brother Law-wrong, an Extra-Ordinary
    Friar. The House crammed full with an audience as brilliant as
    the performance.</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 4</i>.&mdash;Windbag SEXTON
    had fine opportunity to-night; made the most of it. SEYMOUR
    KEAY absent through greater part of sitting. Various rumours
    current in explanation of the happy accident. Influenza hinted
    at; but Grand Young GARDNER, who is familiar with both, says
    <i>Grippe</i> much too knowing to link itself with Member for
    Elgin and Nairn. Towards Eleven o'Clock, rumour set at rest by
    appearance of KEAY. Simple explanation of temporary absence is,
    that he has been at home, drawing up a few more Amendments.</p>

    <p>In his absence. Windbag had it all to himself. How many
    speeches he has made through the dreary sitting am afraid to
    reckon up. Members going off to write letters, smoke a cigar,
    read evening papers, or dine, leave him on his legs, with one
    hand in pocket, and smile of serene satisfaction on face,
    prosing on. Coming back, they find him still in same position,
    apparently saying same thing. Has lately developed new
    oratorical charm. Constantly repeats his sentences, word for
    word. Everybody cleared out, even Mr. G., and JOHN MORLEY. Only
    Prince ARTHUR left languorous on Treasury Bench.</p>

    <p>"Drooping like a lily out of water," MCEWAN says. Not that
    he's given to tropes of the kind; but, being lately at a
    wedding feast smothered in flowers, some of them have got into
    his conversation.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;"Do you think I ought to wear spurs,
    TOBY?"</p>

    <p>It was Old MORALITY who spoke. We were in his room at House;
    just torn ourselves away from Committee on Irish Land Bill,
    where, at the moment, oddly enough SEXTON chanced to be
    speaking. Old MORALITY has been made Lord Warden of the Cinque
    Ports, and is trying on his uniform. Rather piratical
    arrangement; blue cloth coat with large brass buttons, red sash
    round his waist, with holster thrust in it, containing the
    horse-pistol with which PITT armed himself when he sat at the
    window of Walmer Castle, looking across the Channel,
    momentarily expecting to discover BONEY crossing in a
    flat-bottomed boat. The trousers are of scarlet, with broad
    braid of gold lace on outer seams. Finally there is a truculent
    cocked hat, which OLD MORALITY persists in putting on with the
    peak astarn. The dress is picturesque, and OLD MORALITY's
    figure lends itself to it with peculiar grace and fitness.</p>

    <p>"I fancy WELLINGTON wore spurs," the Lord Warden
    persisted.</p>

    <p>Yes, I point out; but PITT didn't, nor did PALMERSTON.
    Anyhow just as well not to begin with spurs. Might in time grow
    up to them, as it were.</p>

    <p>Wanted the Lord Warden to enter House in his uniform: sadly
    in need of sensation. One would certainly be provided if Old
    MORALITY were discovered sitting on Treasury Bench in his
    present costume.</p>

    <p>"No," he said, "they would think I was going to move or
    second the Address. Should like to get used to the clothes a
    little before appearing in them in public places."</p>

    <p>So go back to House myself, leaving the Lord Warden marching
    up and down, making believe he is on the ramparts at Walmer.
    Oddly enough, when I arrive Windbag SEXTON making a speech, the
    few Members present talking about Old MORALITY's promotion. A
    dangerous epoch in a man's life. People apt just then to
    discover all kinds of shortcomings, and reasons why the
    promotion should have fallen elsewhere. But no one grudges OLD
    MORALITY this high and ancient honour; a fresh chapter in the
    pleasant story of "Mr. SMITH," a new "Part of His Life." For
    five years he has sat on the Treasury Bench in succession to
    DISRAELI and GLADSTONE; now he will answer for the safety of
    the Cinque Ports in succession to PITT and WELLINGTON,
    DALHOUSIE and PALMERSTON. <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;OLD
    MORALITY made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;"TAY PAY also among the Gentlemen of
    England!" exclaimed SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, for once almost
    moved out of his customary self-possession. It certainly seems
    so. Came about on Second Reading of London Tramways Bill;
    promoters want to bring tramway over Westminster Bridge, and
    along Embankment. DEMOS desires to go about his business on the
    tramway, and does not see why he should be arbitrarily stopped
    before he has accomplished his journey. Carriage folk say, No;
    let DEMOS and his penny tram stop at other side of the water,
    leaving the broad thoroughfare of the Embankment for what
    RADCLIFFE COOKE called "the gilded chariot."</p>

    <p>Debate gone forward for some time. No one expected to find
    TAY PAY in this Galley. Since his return from Ameriky hasn't
    opened his voice in debate; spoken in public only once. That
    was to his constituents in Scotland Road, Liverpool; announced
    with portentous blast in advance that then and there the
    anxious world should learn what side he took in the leadership
    controversy. Others had declared themselves, whether for Brer
    FOX or Brer RABBIT. The momentous issue of TAY PAY's decision
    required further deliberation. So all the world had to wait
    till TAY PAY came home and saw his constituents. Result not
    altogether satisfactory. As TIM HEALY put it, "TAY PAY showed
    disposition to hunt with Brer FOX and run with Brer RABBIT." If
    in the end Brer FOX won, nothing in TAY PAY's Scotland Road
    speech need prevent him returning to his allegiance. If Brer
    FOX remained under a cloud, he could jog along with Brer
    RABBIT. Been careful not to spoil the little game by taking
    part in debate in House.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/232-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/232-3.png"
             alt="Demos." /></a>Demos.
    </div>

    <p>Now, on this London Tramways Bill, which touches neither
    Brer FOX nor Brer RABBIT, TAY PAY interposes. Conservatives
    snort impatiently when he rises; cry aloud for division; take
    it for granted that TAY PAY will back up DEMOS's demand for
    equal right of way. But TAY PAY has genuine little surprise in
    store; is loftily contemptuous of tramways, doncha. If they
    cross the bridge and approach the precincts of the West End,
    what is to become of carriage-folk? "A noisy and inconvenient
    system of locomotion," said TAY PAY, shuddering with disgust,
    as though he heard a coarse voice crying "Fares, please!"</p>

    <p>House roared with laughter; RADCLIFFE COOKE talked about
    opposition "coming from Members who hoped to ride in gilded
    coaches"; CREMER rudely reminded TAY PAY that ten or fifteen
    years ago, he would have taken a very different view of the
    convenience of tramway cars. This wasn't pleasant; but when the
    Division bell rang, TAY PAY had the satisfaction of walking,
    alone amongst his Party, with the Gentlemen of England,
    triumphantly vindicating the rights of carriage-folk against
    tramway trabs. Long time since House of Commons witnessed a
    scene so rich as this in material for reflection. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;TAY PAY declares against trams.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Attendance on House gradually
    diminishing; what with influenza, and Irish Land Bill in
    Committee, Members gradually thinning off. No M.P. complete
    without his influenza. Barks shall not be out of anything if
    its humble, but conscientious Member can manage it; so I've
    "took" the influenza, or the influenza's "took" me. Don't
    exactly know how it came about. Anyhow, we're in bed together.
    <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Don't know anything about it.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 30th, "George Hotel,"
    Billsbury</i>.&mdash;Spent yesterday and the day before in
    chambers at the Temple. No work as usual. Think I shall give it
    all up, and take entirely to politics. Yesterday afternoon a
    Mr. RICHARDSON GROGRAM called on me by appointment. He had
    written me a long letter stating that he had important
    information to communicate to me with reference to my
    candidature at Billsbury, and desired a short interview in
    order to lay it before me, Said he was "a Billsbury man born
    and bred, and naturally interested in everything that concerned
    the welfare of the old place, though for family reasons he had
    found it best to make the home of his riper manhood in the
    Metropolis." I smelt a rat, but thought it best to give him an
    interview. He is a tall man, with a dark beard, straight dark
    hair, a sallow face and shifty eyes, and was dressed rather
    like a dissenting clergyman. He was immensely genial in his
    manner, said he had read every word of my eloquent speeches,
    and thoroughly agreed with all I had said, though he himself
    would never have been able to say it half as well. He then
    asked me if I had heard of his "History of the Borough of
    Billsbury" in four volumes. I asked him who had published it
    and when, but he said he had been made the victim of intrigues,
    and had not yet secured a publisher, though there was any
    amount of money to be made out of the book. Would I like to
    read it in MS., and give him my candid opinion of it? Excused
    myself on the ground of great pressure of work. He talked like
    this for about twenty minutes, and at last came to what he
    called the chief purport of his visit. He said he had in the
    course of his investigations, been fortunate enough to acquire
    important and exclusive knowledge with regard to the early life
    of Sir THOMAS CHUBSON and his chief supporters in Billsbury.
    "If it is published," he continued, "it will absolutely blast
    the prospects of Radicalism in Billsbury. I am not a grasping
    man, but I must consider my family. Still, Sir, such is my
    respect and liking for you, that I am willing to place a sealed
    packet containing all these stories in your hands on payment of
    £150 down." I told him that wasn't my way either of fighting a
    constituency or of doing business, whereupon he became more
    voluble than ever, and I had no end of a job to get rid of the
    oily beast. JERRAM tells me to-day that he was once a
    solicitor's clerk in Billsbury, and had to leave on account of
    some missing money. Since then he appears to have lived a shady
    life, varied by attempts at blackmail. Faugh!</p>

    <p>Came down to Billsbury to-day, to attend the inaugural
    dinner of the season of the Billsbury Cricket Club. I am a
    Vice-President, and so is CHUBSON. The dinner was held in the
    large room of the "Blue Posts Hotel." General BANNATYNE, an old
    Indian, who is the President of the Club, was in the chair,
    having CHUBSON on his right, and me on his left. Old CHUBSON,
    to whom I was introduced, seems not half a bad old fellow, but
    he can't speak a bit. The dinner was awful, everything as tough
    as leather, and the Cabinet Pudding more beastly than any
    Cabinet Pudding I ever tasted&mdash;which is saying a good
    deal. CHUBSON proposed, "Prosperity to the Billsbury C.C."
    "Politics," he said, "are like Cricket. We spend our time in
    bowling overs." At this point a young Conservative, who had
    drunk too much, shouted, "Ah, and you mostly change sides,
    too"&mdash;an allusion to the fact that CHUBSON is believed to
    have started in politics as a Tory. Somebody removed the
    interrupter, and CHUBSON finished his speech all right, but the
    incident must have annoyed him. I proposed "The Town and Trade
    of Billsbury," and started by saying what pleasure it gave
    anybody occupied in politics to take a part in a non-political
    celebration like this. "My friend, Sir THOMAS CHUBSON," I said,
    "and I have not met before, and I congratulate myself,
    therefore, on having been introduced to him to-day. We shall do
    our level best to bowl one another out, but I know we shall
    play the game according to the rules, and in that spirit of
    fair-play for which Englishmen in general, and Billsbury
    cricketers in particular, are celebrated."</p>

    <p>This was rather mixed, but it went very well. I think I took
    the shine out of CHUBSON. Later on there was a shocking row
    between two of the town-councillors, who got to loggerheads
    over the question of the Billsbury Waterworks. It was smoothed
    over, however, after everybody had shouted "No politics!" for
    about ten minutes.</p>

    <p>TOLLAND says we must begin to canvas a little soon. Horrible
    work, but absolutely necessary.</p>

    <p>A plunge indeed! but fortunately the swimmers are strong,
    and able to save the suicidal Ibsenites. For my
    part,&mdash;that is, as one of the audience drawn by
    curiosity,&mdash;I should say that were it not for the
    excellent acting of all concerned in the piece, and especially
    of Miss ELIZABETH ROBINS as the Hanwellian heroine, IBSEN's
    <i>Hedda Gabler</i> would scarcely have been allowed a second
    night's existence at the Vaudeville. Miss ROBINS is so much in
    earnest&mdash;as a true artist should be&mdash;that she excites
    your curiosity to discover what on earth she is taking all this
    trouble about; and thus she compels your attention. That the
    result is eminently unsatisfactory is no fault of hers. The
    piece itself is stuff and nonsense; poor stuff and "pernicious
    nonsense." It is as if the author had studied the weakest of
    the Robertsonian Comedies, and had thought he could do
    something like it in a tragic vein.</p>

    <p>In the last Act there is a situation reminding us strongly
    of one short scene in <i>Caste; there</i>&mdash;so delicately
    and touchingly treated by its author; <i>here</i>&mdash;so
    repulsively treated by IBSEN. Let it be reduced to serious
    burlesque, and let us have it played by PENLEY as <i>George
    Tesman</i>, ARTHUR ROBERTS (with a song) as <i>Judge Brack</i>,
    WEEDON GROSSMITH as <i>Ejlbert Lövborg</i>, Miss LOTTIE VENNE
    as <i>Mrs. Hedda Tesman</i>, Mrs. JOHN WOOD as <i>Aunt
    Juliana</i>, and Miss JESSIE BOND (with song and dance) as
    <i>Mrs. Elvsted</i>. It is announced in the bill as "IBSEN's
    Last Play." There's a crumb of comfort in this.</p>

    <h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

    <p>OATMEAL PORRIDGE.&mdash;Would some Scotch housewife kindly
    enlighten me as to the proper mode of preparing the above
    delicacy? I fancy there must be some mistake about the method I
    have hitherto adopted. Is it <i>really</i> necessary to "boil
    for forty-eight hours, and then mix with equal quantities of
    gin, Guinness's Stout, Gum Arabic, and Epsom Salts?" I have
    followed this recipe (given me by a young friend, who says he
    has often been in Scotland) faithfully, but the result is not
    wholly satisfactory. I doubt whether genuine porridge should be
    of the consistency of a brick-bat, or taste of
    hair-oil.&mdash;UNDAUNTED.</p>

            <p>Blood speaks&mdash;in favour of the helpless

            <p>Of tyranny. Here's no tame <i>Shylock</i>: he</p>

            <p>Shall not bend low, and in a bondsman's key,</p>

            <p>Make o'er his money-bags with unctuous grace</p>

            <p>To an enthroned enslaver of his race.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p><i>The Diary of a Pilgrimage</i> occupies 175 pages of one
    of ARROWSMITH's three-and-sixpenny books, and no doubt the
    admirers of its author, Mr. JEROME K. JEROME, may possibly not
    grudge this amount when gauging its value by its attractive
    cover. It is "'ARRY Abroad," that's all. 'ARRY Abroad laughs
    and talks loudly in foreign churches, sneers and jeers at
    everything he does not understand&mdash;and this includes the
    greater portion of all he sees and hears&mdash;chaffs puzzled
    officials, and everywhere makes himself highly and
    exceptionally popular. In this <i>Diary</i> 'ARRY is
    occasionally rather amusing when he is endeavouring to be
    either serious or sentimental, or both. 'ARRY serious or 'ARRY
    sentimental, or 'ARRY sentimentally serious and expecting to be
    taken at his own valuation, is of course delightful, only a
    little of it goes a great way, and this Cockney pilgrim goes
    too far, especially when giving us his valuable opinion on the
    Passion Play. 'ARRY on the Passion Play, and the character of
    JUDAS ISCARIOT! As <i>Hedda Gabler's</i> husband observes on
    every possible opportunity&mdash;"Fancy <i>that</i>!" Only once
    the Baron finds himself in agreement with the travelling 'ARRY,
    and this happens when he says, "I must candidly confess that
    the English-speaking people one meets with on the Continent
    are, taken as a whole, a most disagreeable contingent." Yes,
    certainly, when they are all 'Arries. Set an 'ARRY to catch an
    'ARRY, and of course to the regular right-down 'ARRY all other
    'ARRIES, not 'appnin' to 'ave the <i>h</i>onour of being 'is
    own par<i>tics</i>, are detestably vulgar cads. The remainder
    of the book, <i>i.e.</i>, 131 pages, is padded with essays, a
    fact not mentioned on the outside of the work, which, like
    charity, covers a multitude of sins. Whether this is quite a
    fair way of stating contents, is a question which the Baron
    supposes both Publishers and Author have thoroughly
    considered.</p>

    <p>Don't skip ELLEN TERRY's Memoirs in <i>The New Review</i>.
    Nothing much in them, but delightfully chatty and amusing. See
    <i>Murray's Magazine</i> for Mr. GLADSTONE on the <i>Murray
    Memoirs</i>, in the number for the "Murray Month of May." When
    you are routing about for something short and amusing, take up
    the <i>Cornhill</i>, and read <i>A Flash in the Pan</i>. I have
    commenced, says the Baron, my friend GEORGE MEREDITH's <i>One
    of the Conquerors</i>. Now G.M. is an author whose work does
    not admit of the healthy and graceful exercise of skipping.
    Here the skipper's occupation is gone. G.M.'s work should be
    taken away by the reader far from the madding crowd and perused
    and pondered over. If Ponder's End is a tranquil place as the
    name implies, then to that secluded spot betake yourself with
    your GEORGE MEREDITH, O happy and studious reader, and ponder
    in peace.</p>

    <p>Since the time of <i>Richard Feverel</i>, which I shall
    always consider his best, "of the very best" as ZERO of the
    Monte Carlo Bar has it, G.M. has developed into a gold-beater
    of epigrams. What once served him as a two-line epigram, is now
    spread out over a couple of pages. Two volumes instead of three
    would serve his turn far better, or rather the public's turn,
    for his own is a very peculiar one. But to my task, says the
    Baron, give me a slight refresher and a suck at the lemon as it
    were, or a sip of the lemonade, and at him again. <i>Festina
    lente</i>. More anon from</p>

    <h2>ROBERT ON ENGLISH AND FOREIGN WAITERS.</h2>

    <p>Well, things is cumming to a pretty pass, things is, when
    I'm acshally told that, as it used to be said formerly, "No
    Hirish need apply for nothing," so now, we are told, that no
    English Waiters need apply at the Royal Nawal Xhibishun unless
    he bes a German!</p>

    <div class="figright"

             src="images/239.png"
             alt="Robert the Waiter." /></a>

        <h4>"Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the Waves! For
        Britons never, never, NEVER Shall be Slaves!"</h4><i>Robert
        the Waiter</i>. "WHAT'S THIS! 'NO ENGLISH NEED APPLY!
        GERMANS ONLY TAKEN'! THIS <i>IS</i> 'BRITONS NEVER SHALL BE
        SLAVES' WITH A WENGEANCE!"
    </div>

    <p>I never knowed as Jack Tars, and Powder-Munkys, and Admerals
    (as is so fond of Port, that they takes the werry name), was so
    werry parshal to Germans, that they woud sooner go without
    their dinners and tease, than be waited on by any other
    gennelmen, most suttenly not. "<i>O contrare</i>," as the
    French Waiters says. It 'ud be a jolly long time, I shood
    think, before your real British Sailers wood learn to call a
    Waiter a <i>Gasson</i>, tho' as it means, I'm told, a Boy,
    there is sum little sense in it, coz there's, in course. Old
    Boys as well as yung ones; but what on airth meaning is there
    in a Kelner! as I'm acshally told all German Waiters insists on
    being called! Why the thing's too absurd to tork about.</p>

    <p>Besides the British Publick is used to our little ways, as
    we are quite used to theirn, and they talk to us in that nice
    confidenshal tone about the different wines, et setterer, as no
    true Born Englishman ewer yet spoke to a Frenchman, much less a
    German. No, no, the hole thing's a mistake, as will soon be
    found out. And what a groce injustice to the native article.
    These sollem-looking Germans, not content with pushing our poor
    sons from their stools in our counting-houses, as
    <i>Macbeth</i> says, must now cum and take the werry bread out
    of their poor Father's mouths. Oh pale-faced shame, where's
    your blush? And think too of their himperance. Why they are
    acshilly a going for to have a hexibition of their own, here in
    Lundon, and does anyone think as they'll write up on the gates,
    "Only English Waiters need apply?" Why the hidear is ridiclous,
    but where's the difference I should like to kno. No, no, no one
    can kno better than I do, from a long and waried xperience,
    from the Grand old City, the ome of ospitality and turtle soup,
    to the "Grand" and "Metropole," the omes of lucksury and
    refinement, that the British Public likes his British Waiter,
    he likes his nice respecful ways, the helligent Bow with which
    he ands him his At, and the graceful hair with which he
    receeves his little doosure.</p>

    <h2>SPECIMENS FROM MR. PUNCH'S SCAMP-ALBUM.</h2>

    <h4>No. IV.&mdash;THE HUSBAND'S OLD SCHOOL-FELLOW.</h4>

    <p>We will suppose that you are a young wife, and that your
    husband is absent in the City during the greater part of the
    day. One afternoon a card is brought in bearing the
    inscription:&mdash;</p>

    <center>
        CAPTAIN CAULKER.
    </center>

    <center>
        <i>United Service Club. The Hermitage, Coventry</i>.
    </center>

    <p>Which document is followed closely by a tall, well-groomed,
    rather portly and florid stranger, with a military moustache,
    who greets you with the utmost cordiality. "I happened to find
    myself in this neighbourhood," he says, "and I could
    not&mdash;I really could <i>not</i>&mdash;resist this
    opportunity. My name, I venture to think, is a sufficient
    introduction?"</p>

    <p>It is nothing of the sort&mdash;but you are too shy and too
    polite to admit it, so you merely murmur some incoherency. He
    detects you at once. "Ah!" he cries, in good-tempered reproach;
    "I see, I've been too sanguine. Now confess, my dear lady, you
    haven't a <i>notion</i> who I am!"</p>

    <p>Thus brought to bay, you own that you have no clue to your
    visitor's identity&mdash;as yet. "Well&mdash;well," he says,
    tolerantly, "Time is a terrible sponge&mdash;though I had hoped
    that, even after all these years, your dear husband might have
    occasionally mentioned the name of his old school-chum! I've
    never forgotten <i>him</i>&mdash;no, all through the years I've
    been in India I've never forgotten dear old WALTER!"</p>

    <p>"But my husband's name is <i>WILLIAM</i>!" you say here.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/240.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/240.png"
             alt="Captain Caulker." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"He was always WALTER to <i>me</i>, Madam, or
    rather&mdash;WATTY. He was so like a favourite young brother of
    mine, who died young. That drew us together from the first. Did
    dear old WATTY never tell you how he saved my life once?... No?
    So like him!&mdash;he wouldn't. But he did, though; yes, by
    Gad, jumped into fifteen foot of water after me, and kept me up
    when I was going under for the last time. Pardon me, but I see
    a photograph upon your writing-table&mdash;surely, unless I am
    wrong, that&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"That is a portrait of my only brother," you will say; "he
    is out in India with his regiment&mdash;perhaps you may have
    met him there?"</p>

    <p>"Thought I knew the face&mdash;met him at Simla, several
    times," says the Captain; "wonderful how small the world is!
    But have you one of old WATTY's photos? I should so like to see
    whether the dear old chap has altered ... Ah, I should hardly
    have known him&mdash;and yet, yes, the same cheery, jolly look,
    I can trace the boy there, I can see my old WATTY again! No
    friends, my dear Mrs. GOSLING, like those we make in early
    youth! And he never mentions me now? Ah! well, he has a very
    charming excuse for forgetting the past&mdash;though I shall
    tell him when I see him that I do think he might have
    remembered his old school-friend a little better than he seems
    to have done. Your servant informed me that he was seldom at
    home quite so early as this, but I thought if I could not see
    <i>him</i>, I would at least give myself the pleasure of making
    the acquaintance of his wife, so I just ventured to come in for
    five minutes."</p>

    <p>"WILLIAM will be so disappointed to have missed you," you
    say, eagerly; "can't you wait and let me give you some tea? He
    may be back in half an hour."</p>

    <p>"In half an hour? Well, 'pon my word, you tempt me very
    much. I shouldn't like to go away without seeing him, but I
    must send away my cab first&mdash;no, it's not outside, left it
    at the corner of the road, as I wasn't certain of the
    number&mdash;I s'pose I've got enough silver to&mdash;no, I
    haven't, by Jove! <i>Could</i> you oblige me by change for
    a&mdash;well, really, this is very awkward. I've positively
    come out with only a shilling&mdash;thought it was a sovereign!
    I shall have to ask dear old WATTY to accommodate me&mdash;I've
    lent <i>him</i> many a half-crown in the old days. Absurd
    predicament to be in, and if I keep my cabman waiting, I don't
    know what he mayn't charge me. I took him three hours ago. I
    tell you what, my dear Mrs. GOSLING; If you'll advance me a
    sovereign, I could run out and settle with the fellow, and then
    it won't signify <i>how</i> long I wait for WATTY. <i>Can</i>
    you? Too good of you, I'm sure! WATTY will chaff me when he
    hears I've been borrowing like this, ha, ha!" Here your ear,
    sharpened by affection, catches a well-known turn of the
    latch-key at your front-door. "Why, how fortunate!" you
    exclaim, "here <i>is</i> my husband already, Captain CAULKER.
    He will come in as soon as he has changed his shoes."</p>

    <p>"Capital!" cries the Captain. "Look here, Mrs.
    GOSLING,&mdash;I've just thought of a little joke. I want to
    see if he'll <i>know</i> me. Now you go and talk to him a
    little, and&mdash;presently, you know&mdash;say there's a man
    in the drawing-room, who's come to wind the clocks, and then
    I'll come in to where you are, and make believe to wind the
    clock there&mdash;do you see? I'd bet anything he won't spot me
    at first!"</p>

    <p>You are young enough to be delighted at the idea of such a
    pretty little comedy, and you trip away to the study, and
    archly keep dear WILLIAM in conversation until the Captain is
    ready to make his appearance. At last, a little impatiently,
    you give the cue by mentioning that there is a clock-winder in
    the drawing-room. WILLIAM is amusingly suspicious, and insists
    on seeing the man. As the scene will be just as funny in the
    drawing-room, you accompany him thither&mdash;but there is no
    gallant Captain there affecting to wind your charming little
    Sèvres clock (a wedding present)&mdash;he has gone,
    and&mdash;alas! without leaving a timepiece for anybody else to
    wind. And WILLIAM is <i>most</i> disagreeable and unpleasant
    about it!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
